##0x0A-python-inheritance
###0-lookup.py 
a function that returns the list of available attributes and methods of an object:
###1-my_list.py 
a class MyList that inherits from list:
Public instance method: def print_sorted(self): that prints the list, but sorted (ascending sort)
###2-is_same_class.py
a function that returns True if the object is exactly an instance of the specified class ; otherwise False.
Prototype: def is_same_class(obj, a_class):
###3-is_kind_of_class.py
 a function that returns True if the object is an instance of, or if the object is an instance of a class that inherited from, the specified class ; otherwise False.
###4-inherits_from.py
a function that returns True if the object is an instance of a class that inherited (directly or indirectly) from the specified class ; otherwise False.
###5-base_geometry.py
an empty class BaseGeometry.
###6-base_geometry.py
a class BaseGeometry (based on 5-base_geometry.py).
Public instance method: def area(self): that raises an Exception with the message area() is not implemented
###7-base_geometry.py
a class BaseGeometry (based on 6-base_geometry.py).

Public instance method: def area(self): that raises an Exception with the message area() is not implemented
Public instance method: def integer_validator(self, name, value): that validates value:
you can assume name is always a string
if value is not an integer: raise a TypeError exception, with the message <name> must be an integer
if value is less or equal to 0: raise a ValueError exception with the message <name> must be greater than 0
###8-rectangle.py
a class Rectangle that inherits from BaseGeometry (7-base_geometry.py).

Instantiation with width and height: def __init__(self, width, height):
width and height must be private. No getter or setter
width and height must be positive integers, validated by integer_validator
###9-rectangle.py
a class Rectangle that inherits from BaseGeometry (7-base_geometry.py). (task based on 8-rectangle.py)

Instantiation with width and height: def __init__(self, width, height)::
width and height must be private. No getter or setter
width and height must be positive integers validated by integer_validator
the area() method must be implemented
print() should print, and str() should return, the following rectangle description: [Rectangle] <width>/<height>
###10-square.py
a class Square that inherits from Rectangle (9-rectangle.py):
Instantiation with size: def __init__(self, size)::
size must be private. No getter or setter
size must be a positive integer, validated by integer_validator
the area() method must be implemented
###11-square.py
a class Square that inherits from Rectangle (9-rectangle.py). (task based on 10-square.py).

Instantiation with size: def __init__(self, size)::
size must be private. No getter or setter
size must be a positive integer, validated by integer_validator
the area() method must be implemented
print() should print, and str() should return, the square description: [Square] <width>/<height>
###100-my_int.py
a class MyInt that inherits from int:

MyInt is a rebel. MyInt has == and != operators inverted
###101-add_attribute.py
a function that adds a new attribute to an object if it’s possible:
